# Sorter
<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to Sorter! This is my Python implementation of a sorting algorithm
visualizer. The program can be exucted simply with:

python3 sorter.py

This will open up the GUI for Sorter, implemented using pygame. On the top bar
of the GUI you will find buttons to:
1. Halve the number of elements to sort 
2. Double the number of elements to sort 
3. Reset (scramble) the bars to sort. This also halts any in-progress sort
4. Execute quick sort
5. Execute heap sort
6. Execute merge sort
7. Execute bubble sort

All algorithms have been implemented as in-place so that the bars may update as
the sorting is occurring. There will be a programmed delay between each
swapping/moving of the elements in the array, and this delay is scaled with how
many bars are on the screen. This is done such that the less bars you have on
the screen, the slower the bars are moved, and vice versa. This way sorting
many bars does not take too long meanwhile sorting few bars provides a clear
execution procedure.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy using the application!
