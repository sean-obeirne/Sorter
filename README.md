# Sorter
Sorter is my sorting algorithm visualization tool implemented using python3 and PyGame!

It implements 4 sorting algorithms with a clear visual representation of the algorithm, and might be useful as an education tool!

To run, simply clone the repo or download the .py file and run 'python3 sorter.py'.
